### **Introduction**

This repository is a collection of the programming related projects I have done over the course of our degree. It will be a foundation to better learn the software development cycle, from planning and development to execution as well as testing and maintenance.

### **Programming Fundamentals**

Programming Basics taught in C++14/17. Covers the basics including keywords, conditionals, loops, arrays, pointers, structures, file handling etc.

### **Object Oriented Programming**

Programming Project made using Object Oriented concepts in C++. Using external libraries and multiple resources learnt in class

### **Data Structures and Algorithms**

Python datastructures implemented and used with respective algorithms. Data is also maniuplated in various ways
