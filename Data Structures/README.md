## **CAR WASH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM**
---
### **Introduction**

Using Data structures in python, we have created a console program which can be used to manage a Car wash system. Proper ordering, queue system and billing receipts are created for each order in the system. 

### **Planning**
We use a variety of different functions for this program to work. An order function helps the user place an order after which a secondary system adds the user's order to a queue
Once ordering phase is done the tasks are carried out in a *FIFO* fashion and afterwards a receipt is printed for each order that is completed.

### **Development**
Development is done using Python3.

Only native libraries are used for this program. Just put the files in one folder and run Menu.py

### **Future Plans**
We can add a GUI using one of Python's libraries such as tkinter or PyQT5 or even a console based system.

Further expand the Multithreading capability to run multiple orders while orders are being taken and executed simultaneously.

Other features and additions as per the required need can also be implemented.
