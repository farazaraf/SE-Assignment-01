## **SNAKE GAME PROJECT**
---
This is a programming fundamentals project where we have created a console based text version of the popular snakes and ladders game

### **Prerequisites** 
* C++
* Visual Studio
* Compile and Run directly from the IDE.
* Can be compiled by G++ as well

### **Planning**
The game uses various techniques and fundamental methods in programming such as loops and conditionals

Input and Output are handled by *iostream* and game logic runs in a do-while game loop.

### **Execution** 
Execution is very fast as the entire game is less than 10KB. You play against a computer and take turns rolling a dice. The dice randomness is using C++'s internal random number generator library function

### **Further Development**
A graphics based version can be developed as well as a version where two players can take turns / Player vs Player game. Feel free to report bugs during gameplay.
